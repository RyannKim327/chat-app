> This is just a simple web based so-called application that update everytime. I also added some user credentials here like using of cookies, to avoid multiple accounts, and also the admin clear chat command, ban a user, and unban user. To avoid spams, I use the if last two chat, no input method, so that the spam may be prevented.
